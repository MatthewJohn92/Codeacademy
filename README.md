# Matteo Luca's Codecademy School Projects

Hello! I'm Matteo Luca. This repository is a living archive of my ongoing school projects with Codecademy. As I embark on this educational journey, diving into various domains of web development and programming, this repository will be updated to showcase my evolving skills and accomplishments.

## Overview

My adventure with Codecademy has just begun. As I navigate through the vast landscape of web development, from front-end to back-end, and eventually full-stack, this repository will serve as a testament to my dedication, passion, and growth.

## Technologies I'm Exploring

- **Front-End**: Starting with the basics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and looking forward to more advanced topics.
- **Back-End**: Eager to dive into technologies like Node.js, Express.js, SQL, and more.
- **Full-Stack**: Can't wait to integrate both front-end and back-end technologies for comprehensive web solutions.
- **Others**: Open to exploring any and every technology that comes my way.

## Projects

As I progress through my lessons, I'll be pushing projects to this repository.


## What I've Learned (Ongoing)

With every lesson and project, I'm gaining new insights and skills. Here's a summary of my learning journey so far:

- **HTML**: Grasping the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Delving into the design and aesthetics of web development.
- **JavaScript**: Just scratched the surface and excited to dive deeper.

(Updates will be made as I progress through my courses.)

## Looking Ahead

I'm enthusiastic about the road ahead. With every push to this repository, I'll be one step closer to my goal of becoming a proficient web developer. If you're reading this, I invite you to join me on this journey, witness my growth, and perhaps share some insights or feedback.
